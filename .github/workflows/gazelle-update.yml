            This PR was automatically generated by the gazelle-update workflow.

            ## Changes
            The following BUILD files have been updated by running gazelle
            on the examples module:

            ```
            ${{ steps.check_changes.outputs.changed_files }}
            ```

            ## Details
            - Gazelle was run on the examples module: `bazel run //:gazelle`
            - BUILD files were automatically generated/updated based on CMake
              projects
            - All changes are from the gazelle plugin parsing CMake
              configurations

            Please review the changes and merge if they look correct.
